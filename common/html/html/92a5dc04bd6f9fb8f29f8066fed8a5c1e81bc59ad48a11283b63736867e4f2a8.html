This is being generated "after the fact", so it's quite possible that some things that should be moved here haven't been moved here yet, and may never move here. At the present time, this package includes mainly the types and subprograms I found myself re-using for most of the two-dimensional map puzzles.<p>There are three subpackages: &lt;ul> &lt;li>The &lt;tt>Two_Dimensional_Motion&lt;/tt> package stands on its own, and offers types (and one function) useful for moving in one of the four cardinal directions.&lt;/li> &lt;li>The &lt;tt>Two_Dimensional_Map&lt;/tt> package likewise stands on its own, and offers basic functionality for a two-dimensional map, including a `Location_Record` type that documents a row and a column, as well as a lexicographic ordering on that type that enables you to use it in ordered sets or maps.&lt;/li> &lt;li>The &lt;tt>Two_Dimensional_Map_IO&lt;/tt> package does not stand on its own, but requires the previous declaration of a &lt;tt>Two_Dimensional_Map&lt;/tt>. It will automatically adjust the filename when doing an example. &lt;/li> &lt;/ul>
